# Udacity A/B Testing to Determine the Effect of Free Trial Screener

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether asking students about time commitment prior to enrolling in a course improves the overall student experience. 

At the time of the experiment, Udacity courses have two options on the course
overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If students click "start free trial", they are enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they are automatically be charged
unless they cancel first. If students click "access course materials", they are able to access the course material for free but cannot get coaching support or a certificate.

In this experiment, Udacity made a change so that when a student clicks "start free trial", they are asked how much time they can invest in the course. If they replied with 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. Otherwise, a message that suggested the student to access the course materials for free was shown. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial or access the course materials for free instead.

The hypothesis was that this Free Trial Screener might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing
the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough
time â€” without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and
eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall
student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to
complete the course.
