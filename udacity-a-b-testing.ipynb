If the feature achieved this without significantly reducing the number of students who continue past the free trial, it would be successful.\n\nBased on the results above, I recommend to not launch the feature and pursue other experiments instead. It has caused a significant change in gross conversion, which represents the probability of enrolling per click, but not in net conversion, which is more closely related to Udacity's business goals. This means that there was a decrease in enrollment, but no significant changes in students staying past the 14 days boundary to pay for the course.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
